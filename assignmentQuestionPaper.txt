ASIA PACIFIC UNIVERSITY ESPORTS 
CHAMPIONSHIP MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
(Working Duration: Monday of Week 10 to Monday of Week 14 – 30 Marks) 
STORY BACKGROUND: 
The Asia Pacific University Esports Championship (APUEC) has become one of the most 
anticipated collegiate esports tournaments in Asia, attracting top gamers from universities 
across the region. Hosted annually by Asia Pacific University (APU), this event is more than 
just a gaming competition, it celebrates skill, teamwork, and strategic thinking. 
Given the scale and complexity of the tournament, efficient management is essential. APU has 
taken an innovative approach by leveraging advanced data structures to enhance scheduling, 
player management, spectator experience, and match tracking. The tournament committee has 
identified key areas where Stacks, Queues, Priority Queues, and Circular Queues can 
optimize operations for a seamless competition. 
CHALLENGES: 
Managing an esports championship requires handling multiple components efficiently, 
including: 
 Match Scheduling & Player Progression, ensuring players compete fairly through 
qualifier, group, and knockout stages. 
 Tournament Registration & Player Queueing, managing sign-ups, check-ins, and last
minute entries efficiently. 
 Live Stream & Spectator Queue Management, prioritizing VIPs, streamers, and 
audience engagement. 
 Game Result Logging & Performance History, keeping an accurate record of match 
outcomes, stats, and highlights.

Lab Work #2 – Program & Live Presentation Guidelines (30 Marks) 
Team & Submission Requirements 
1. Each team must have up to FOUR (4) members. 
2. Your team is required to use C++ to develop ONLY ONE (1) prototype in this section, 
without using STL containers like <list> or <vector>. 
3. Each team member must be responsible for AT LEAST ONE (1) of the following 
tasks, applying the appropriate data structures and algorithms. 
o Task 1: Match Scheduling & Player Progression 
o Task 2: Tournament Registration & Player Queuing 
o Task 3: Live Stream & Spectator Queue Management 
o Task 4: Game Result Logging & Performance History 
Marks awarded will be based on individual contributions, considering each member's 
responsibility in the system and how accurately you can justify your selection of data structures 
and algorithms. 
4. The evaluation criteria for this lab work #2 also include assessing the clarity and 
structural design of the code, as well as the quality of comments and adherence to good 
programming practices. (e.g., indentation, meaningful identifier names, comments, 
etc.).  
5. This task requires a group submission, but grading will be based on everyone’s 
contribution to the system.  
The team leader must upload a ZIP file of the system solution to the Moodle system by 
Monday of Week 14, no later than 5:00 pm. 
 Include only .cpp, .hpp, and .csv/text files. 
 Follow this file naming format: 
<GroupNo>_<TeamLeaderID>_<1stMemberID>_<2ndMemberID>_<3
 rdMemberID>.zip 
 For example, “G1_TP012345_TP014556_TP067554_TP034325.zip” 
Refer to Page 6 for marking criteria of this Lab Evaluation Work #2 submission. 
6. After submitting your system code to Moodle, your team must schedule a live 
presentation with your lecturer between Tuesday of Week 14 to Friday of Week 16 
(Your final exam week #1).
